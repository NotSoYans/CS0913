#Comuputer Science REBC02-2017

The homework assignment can be found already integrated in [gitUL].
Additionally I have improved [gitDL] - included graphical interface for multiple git repo selection.

For more info on how it's made consult [devExp].


~~Also there may be a bug concerning history file automation.~~
Not a bug, just a dependancy issue. Rectified but the result is not ideal. Regardless - it's functional.
